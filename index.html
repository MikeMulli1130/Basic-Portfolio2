    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>
     I was born on the east side of Cleveland, Ohio, in St. Ann's hospital. It was located at Fairhill and MLK Roads. It has since burned down - I don't think I was in any way the cause - and has not existed for decades. I don't know what became of all those records. My parents both emigrated to the United States from Ireland. My brother and I are first-generation Americans. I grew up on the Near West Side of Cleveland (close to, but definitely not in, Ohio City). I graduated from Lincoln-West High School. </p>
     <p>I went to CWRU and earned my first undergrad degree (BA, History). I like to say I was pre-law, then pre-unemployment, when I graduated in the early 80s. The economy was a little rough in the early 80s - contrary to some revisionist history. Things did get better in the later 80s. Anyway, since I had decided not to go to law school, I got a job in journalism. My second bachelor's is in nursing (from CSU). I worked in various surgical cardiothoracic intensive care units at Cleveland Clinic. I also have a master's in informatics from Thomas Edison State University (NJ). Now here in 2018, I am hoping to learn to code!</p> 
  <p>I am married and have one child who is all grown up now. She has just finished nursing school and has owned the Pork Chop Shop at the West Side Market since 2012. I am very proud of her. Kids are a lot of fun, at every age. Being a parent isn't always fun, but kids are definitely fun. Enjoy them, they grow up fast! We (my husband and I) currently "parent" a cat named Kitty-Buddy. My husband and I like to go on trail trips where we work with American Hiking Society to work on trails all over the USA. We were just in Washington State in June, I love the Pacific NW.</p>
